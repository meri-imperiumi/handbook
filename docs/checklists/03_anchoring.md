# Anchoring

_Lille Ø_ is equipped with three anchors:

* **Rocna Vulcan 15** bow anchor with 40m of 8mm chain
* **Bruce 15kg** stern anchor with 5m of 8mm chain and 45m of webbing line
* **Fortress Fx-11** kedge anchor

## Bow anchor

Bow anchoring is used in most anchorages outside of Scandinavia.

### Preparing to anchor

- [ ] Check weather forecast and ensure that anchorage has appropriate protection (especially regarding waves or katabatic winds)
- [ ] Check chart for appropriate depth and swinging room
- [ ] Check other vessels for appropriate swinging room
- [ ] Double-check chart data with depth sounder
- [ ] Remove the safety shackle from anchor
- [ ] Uncoil and prepare the anchor buoy line
- [ ] Prepare appropriate anchor chain on deck (about 4✕ depth)
- [ ] Prepare for setting up anchor alarm (log [into Signal K](http://192.168.1.105/@signalk/freeboard-sk/) etc)
- [ ] Prepare intercom headsets

### Setting the anchor

- [ ] Approach the anchoring spot slowly towards the wind
- [ ] Stop the vessel
- [ ] Drop anchor until it hits the bottom
- [ ] Enable anchor alarm
- [ ] Toss out the anchor buoy
- [ ] Start backing the boat and release chain slowly
- [ ] Once the correct scope is reached, lock the chain
- [ ] Let the anchor set for a short moment
- [ ] Then start backing again, slowly increasing power
- [ ] Check that the anchor holds (transits to landmarks, speed 0kt when chain tight)
- [ ] When setting anchor with engine, about 1500 RPM is a good number to reach
- [ ] Pull up and reanchor if the anchor doesn't hold

### After anchor is set

- [ ] Connect a snubber line to the anchor chain with a rolling hitch
- [ ] Let out the snubber and chain until about 2-3m of snubber is out of the boat and cleat it
- [ ] Set a chafe guard on the snubber
- [ ] Let out about 3m more of chain so that it hangs loose and we're on the snubber
- [ ] Hoist the anchor daymark
- [ ] Turn anchor light on as required
- [ ] Follow the [[04_after_sailing|after sailing]] checklist
- [ ] Keep engine or the genoa ready for use in case of emergencies

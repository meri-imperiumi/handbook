## Boom preventer

Whenever the boom is outside the cockpit it should be set up with a boom preventer. There are pre-installed preventer lines on the boom that can be used conveniently for this purpose.

Setup is the following:

- [ ] Open the rope clutch controlling the preventer line (red or green)
- [ ] Attach preventer line block to the forward cleat
- [ ] Unhook the on-boom preventer pennant and attach to the preventer line
- [ ] Slightly open the boom with the main sheet
- [ ] Pull preventer line tight with the sheet winch and close the rope clutch
- [ ] Tighten main sheet

## Poling out the headsail

- [ ] Attach whisker pole uphaul to the end of the pole
- [ ] Attach forward and aft guy lines to the end of the pole
- [ ] For staysail, install the extra "poling out sheet"
- [ ] Lower the whisker pole so that it is easily accessible
- [ ] Hook the sheet through the whisker pole jaws
- [ ] Hoist and tension the pole using the uphaul and the guys. Pole should be completely immobilised
- [ ] Tack or unroll the headsail to the poled out side

## Parasailor

Our Parasailor is the primary downwind sail in light-to-medium conditions. The suitable range is around 4kt-25kt of true wind.
Typically we use the Parasailor without the mainsail.

A good rule of thumb is that the sail should be prepared and ready to use whenever conditions are light. As soon as there are whitecaps visible on the water (around 5bft/21kt), the Parasailor should be stowed away.

### Setting up the Parasailor

- [ ] Carry the Parasailor bag to foredeck and attach to mast
- [ ] Roll in the genoa
- [ ] Install tack lines rollers to the bowsprit
- [ ] Install barberhaulers to the Parasailor sheets
- [ ] Install Parasailor sheets and attach to pulpit
- [ ] Set course to about 120° apparent wind
- [ ] Attach the spinnaker halyard to the Parasailor
- [ ] Hoist the Parasailor sock, keeping control of the snubber line
- [ ] Cleat the snubber line to prevent accidental opening
- [ ] Attach sheets and tack lines to the Parasailor
- [ ] Drop the main sail
- [ ] Attach a snatch block to front cleat and the snubber line
- [ ] Hoist the sock in a controlled manner with the snubber line
- [ ] While the sail is opening, slighly tighten the Parasailor sheet
- [ ] Get back on course and trim the Parasailor

### Dousing the Parasailor

- [ ] Set course to about 120° apparent wind
- [ ] Attach a snatch block to front cleat and the snubber line
- [ ] Start pulling the sock down
- [ ] While sock is being pulled, ease the Parasailor sheet
- [ ] Have a short pause at the Parasailor wing to allow the air to be spilled
- [ ] Pull the sock fully down and cleat to prevent accidental opening
- [ ] Detach sheets and tack lines from the Parasailor
- [ ] Hoist the main sail
- [ ] Open the Parasailor bag and move the bottom end of the sock there
- [ ] Lower the Parasailor sock into the bag
- [ ] Close the Parasailor bag and stow the spinnaker halyard
- [ ] Stow Parasailor sheets
- [ ] Move tack line rollers back to bow cleats

# Navigation

We use the following applications for navigation:

* [Orca CoPilot](https://getorca.com) as the "mobile chartplotter" for routing, charts, and autopilot control
* [Navionics Boating](https://www.navionics.com/fin/apps/navionics-boating) for inland waters and tight anchorages
* [Sailmate](https://www.sailmate.com) for official Finnish raster charts
* [LuckGrib](https://luckgrib.com) for offshore weather routing

## Planning a coastal/inland route

- [ ] Check the [[weather]] forecast
- [ ] Decide on the target point
- [ ] Create an autoroute to target point in the navigation app
- [ ] Scroll through the route and check for any difficult spots or needed optimizations
- [ ] Double check the route with another chart source
- [ ] Move waypoints from autoroute as necessary
- [ ] Check the harbour guide for any suitable anchorages or safe harbours on the way and mark them on the chart

## Planning an offshore route

- [ ] Check the pilot chart for prevailing conditions
- [ ] Check notices for mariners for any restrictions in the area
- [ ] Mark restrictions as boundaries for the weather routing app
- [ ] Download latest [[weather#Offshore weather|offshore weather]] for the area
- [ ] Create weather route with appropriate variations
- [ ] When suitable route and departure window has been found, transfer route to plotter app
- [ ] Scroll through the route and check for any difficult spots or needed optimizations
- [ ] Move waypoints from route as necessary
- [ ] Check the harbour guide for any suitable anchorages or safe harbours on the way and mark them on the chart

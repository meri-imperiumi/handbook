# Navigation

We use the following applications for navigation:

* [Orca CoPilot](https://getorca.com) as the "mobile chartplotter" for routing, charts, and autopilot control
* [Navionics Boating](https://www.navionics.com/fin/apps/navionics-boating) for inland waters and tight anchorages
* [Sailmate](https://www.sailmate.com) for official Finnish raster charts
* [LuckGrib](https://luckgrib.com) for offshore weather routing

## Cockpit chartplotter
We use a Samsung Galaxy Tab Active3 waterproof tablet as the cockpit chartplotter.
Install the tablet to its holder in the cockpit and enable charging via the "tablet" switch next to the companionway. This will charge the tablet with 9V.
The tablet will receive navigational information including AIS targets from the boat WiFi network.

## Planning a coastal/inland route

- [ ] Check the [[weather]] forecast
- [ ] Decide on the target point
- [ ] Create an autoroute to target point in the navigation app
- [ ] Scroll through the route and check for any difficult spots or needed optimizations
- [ ] Double check the route with another chart source
- [ ] Move waypoints from autoroute as necessary
- [ ] Check the harbour guide or [No Foreign Land](https://www.noforeignland.com/) for any suitable anchorages or safe harbours on the way and mark them on the chart

## Planning an offshore route

- [ ] Check the pilot chart for prevailing conditions
- [ ] Check notices for mariners for any restrictions in the area
- [ ] Mark restrictions as boundaries for the weather routing app
- [ ] Download latest [[weather#Offshore weather|offshore weather]] for the area
- [ ] Create weather route with appropriate variations
- [ ] When suitable route and departure window has been found, transfer route to plotter app
- [ ] Scroll through the route and check for any difficult spots or needed optimizations
- [ ] Move waypoints from route as necessary
- [ ] Check the harbour guide for any suitable anchorages or safe harbours on the way and mark them on the chart

# Electrics

_Lille Ø_ runs both a 12V DC system and a 220V AC system, the latter powered by either shore power or an onboard inverter.

## Storage

The boat has two battery banks:

* 100Ah lead-acid starter battery located in the port cockpit locker
* 2✕ 200Ah LiFePO4 house bank located under the technical compartment

The two battery banks are normally isolated from each other, except for:

* There is a 30A DC-DC charger to charge house bank from the starter circuit when alternator is running
* The inverter-charger trickle-charges the starter bank from house circuit at 1A when house bank is charging

## Production

### Fixed solar panels

The vessel has two fixed solar panels:

* 150W panel on the stern arch
* 60W panel on top of the hatch garage

Each of these is connected to its own Victron SmartSolar charge controller.

### FLINsail

The boat carries a deployable 300W [FLINsail](https://flin-solar.de). This is a set of three panels that can be hoisted in the mast like a mainsail.

**Note: The maximum wind speed for deploying the FLINsail is 18kt**

#### Deploying the FLINsail

* [ ] Attach the FLINsail bag on top of the boom
* [ ] Open the bag and attach the main halyard to the hook labeled _Head_
* [ ] Attach the hook labeled _Clew_ to the end of the boom
* [ ] Attach the hook labeled _Tack_ to the soft shackle hanging under the boom gooseneck
* [ ] Pull main halyard until first panel is over the sail entry gate
* [ ] Attach the sail slide into the mainsail rail
* [ ] Repeat until all three panels are attached to the rail
* [ ] Pull main halyard until all is nice and tight
* [ ] Turn the panels and the boom towards the sun
* [ ] Get the solar MC4 cable from under the deck solar panel and attach to the connectors on the FLINsail

### Alternator

The [[engine]] has been upgraded with a **A2120S** 80A alternator. This charges the starter battery circuit (and house bank via a DC-DC charger).

# Monitor audio quality on Yealink phones


The last few days I have been troubleshooting some quality issues. While doing this I found a tool that has been very helpful and wanted to share it with the group.  
  
It is easy to monitor the audio quality on a Yealink phone, and it can be done remotely. I was able to watch in real-time as a user was on a call.

**Directions**  

- Log into the Yealink phone from the administrative portal. You can get the IP address by pressing the ok button on the phone. The default user/pass is admin/admin until it is changed.
- Go to the Settings tab
- Click on the Voice monitoring tab on the left
- Change the following settings:
- VQ RTCP-XR Session Report = Enabled
- VQ RTCP-XR Interval Report = Enabled
- Period for Interval Report = 5
- Display Report Options on Web = Enabled
- Voice RTCP-XR Report = Enabled
- Add the options you want to the Enabled column
- Click Confirm
- Make a call using this phone.
- On the top menu, go to Status
- Click on the RTP Status tab on the left

Now you can view the stats of the last call. The stats will also update every 5 seconds during the call. This value is set above in the "Period for Interval Report" settings. The value range is 5-20.

**Extra information:**  
  
Packet Loss - If Packets are lost during a call, the user will hear an audio drop or 'glitch'. In most scenarios, the packets are lost in the local network or internet connection from the customer.  
  
MOS - Mean Opinion Score - is a measure used to give a call a score. The MOS is expressed as a single rational number, typically in the range 1â€“5, where 1 is the lowest perceived quality, and 5 is the highest perceived quality. VoIP calls often are in the 3.5 to 4.2 MOS range. The following chart can be used as a guide for VoIP MOS testing and a good comparison for voice quality.

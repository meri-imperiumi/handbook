While doing this I found a tool that has been very helpful and wanted to share it with the group.  </p> <p>It is easy to monitor the audio quality on a Yealink phone, and it can be done remotely. I was! able to watch in real-time as a user was on a call.  </p> <p>Click here to enlarge image. </p> <p>Click here to enlarge image. </p> <p>Directions </p> <ul> <li>Log into the Yealink phone from the administrative portal.

In most scenarios, the packets are lost in the local network or internet connection from the customer.  </p> <p>MOS - Mean Opinion Score - is a measure used to give a call a score. The MOS is expressed as a single rational number, typically in the range 1\u20135, where 1 is the lowest perceived quality, and 5 is the highest perceived quality. VoIP calls often are in the 3.5 to 4.2 MOS range. The following chart can be used as a guide for VoIP MOS testing and a good comparison for voice quality.  </p> Number Yeah 4.3 - 5.0 Very satisfied 4.0 - 4.3 Satisfied 3.6 - 4.0 Some users are satisfied 3.1 - 3.6 Many users dissatisfied 2.6 - 3.1 Nearly all users are dissatisfied 1.0 - 2.6 All users are dissatisfied"},{"location":"Extra/PIE%20CHART/","title":"PIE CHART","text":"pie     title Amount of time spent on md     \"Making it look good\" : 42.96     \"Adding data\" : 50.05     \"Others\" : 10.01     \"Too much percent\" :  5  <ul> <li> Plans at work<ul> <li> Make vanilla pudding.
